## App Name: Find the Cause

### Team Overview:
Jacob Rottenberg -- jrott36

### Application Idea:
Paragraph or two describing application and data it works with
A single page web application that allows users to search for different charities, and rate them. Ideally, by typing in a phrase related to a cause they can see a list of charities that support the cause and be redirected to one that they click on. There will also ideally be a group subscribe option where a user can enter their email and automatically subscribe to multiple mailing lists instead of having to go to each site and subscribe.

### Functionality:
Paragraph or two explaining functionality provided by application, how it is used, and how it interacts
with the data it maintains
